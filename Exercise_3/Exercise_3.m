%% ðŸ’» Exercise #3: Essentiality prediction & evaluation
% The goal of this exercise is to generate gene and reaction essentiality predictions, 
% using FBA and TFA-based approaches.
% 
% Finally, we also predict reaction essentiality on the merged _E. coli_ and 
% ATLAS subset model to identify rescued reactions.

% so we can look at GFmodel.rxnRescued structure and see that AMAOTr is present

% if PrepareForGapFilling() was run with essentiality flag
% set to 1, the model will have structure rxnRescued = rxnEssentialWT - rxnEssentialMerged
% with the thermo flag set to 0 these predictions are FBA based, with
% thermo flag set to 1 these predictions are TFA based

%% Identify false negatives as targets for gapfilling
% These are genes that are predicted to be lethal when KO'd, yet experiments 
% show otherwise. This means that there must be missing pathways that can compensate 
% for gene KO. To gap-fill for these, we KO the reaction and then generate alternatives 
% that can restore growth.

% merge TFA-based gene essentiality predictions with essentiality experiment data
essentiality_eval = innerjoin(TTFA_genes, essentiality_table, 'Keys', 'Genes');

% calculate FN, TN, FP, TP
FN = essentiality_eval(essentiality_eval.grRatio < 0.1 & strcmp(essentiality_eval.Essential, 'FALSE'), :); % 136 FN
TN = essentiality_eval(essentiality_eval.grRatio < 0.1 & strcmp(essentiality_eval.Essential, 'TRUE'), :); % 103 TN
FP = essentiality_eval(essentiality_eval.grRatio > 0.1 & strcmp(essentiality_eval.Essential, 'TRUE'), :); % 43 FP
TP = essentiality_eval(essentiality_eval.grRatio > 0.1 & strcmp(essentiality_eval.Essential, 'FALSE'), :); % 1142 TP

% I can see that the gene bioA (b0774) is found in the FN structure, meaning that
% it is experimentally non-essential but computationally essential.
% Furthermore, we find associated reaction AMAOTr in the set of rescued
% reactions, meaning that it is computationally essential in the original
% model but no longer in the merged model. Lets generate some alternative
% solutions for gapfilling next. This is a gapfilling target in figure 3 of
% the NICEgame paper
